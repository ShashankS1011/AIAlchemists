This application is designed to optimize the supply chain process by providing both suppliers and buyers with intelligent, real-time recommendations. Leveraging the power of Intel oneAPI for faster and efficient computing, the app focuses on two main functionalities:

For Suppliers: It offers optimal delivery paths based on geographic data, real-time demand, and transportation costs, ensuring fast and cost-effective routes to deliver materials.
For Buyers: The app provides optimal recommendations on suppliers, helping buyers make data-driven decisions based on material price, availability, and delivery time.
Key Features:
Supplier Optimization: Calculates the most efficient delivery routes based on location, demand, and material specifics.
Buyer Recommendations: Suggests the best supplier options based on pricing, availability, and location proximity.
High-Performance Computing: Utilizes Intel oneAPI for faster calculations and model predictions, ensuring real-time optimization.
Machine Learning Integration: Incorporates ML models in TFLITE format for path optimization and supplier recommendations.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Java with XML for Android.
Backend: Python with Intel oneAPI for model training and optimization.
Database: Firebase real-time database.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow Lite (TFLITE) models.
Usage:
Suppliers input material details, price, quantity, and location.
Buyers provide material requirements and location preferences.
The app processes this data to give the most efficient options for both parties.
